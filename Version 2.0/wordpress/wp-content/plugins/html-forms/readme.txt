Not just another contact form plugin.

== Description ==

With [HTML Forms](https://htmlforms.io/), you can easily add multi-purpose forms to your WordPress site.

The idea behind HTML Forms is different than most other form builder plugins: **You manage the form HTML. The plugin manages the PHP and a tiny bit of JavaScript**.

That's right. No "intuitive" drag & drop interface. We believe that dynamic form builders can be great, but they also severely limit your options. Also, they're slow and overly complicated from a technical point of view.

HTML Forms aims to be simpler, faster and smarter.

You define your form fields in HTML and the plugin takes care of submitting the form, saving the data and running a configurable set of form actions.

> ### 1. Define your form fields
> You can use anything that is valid HTML. Just ensure all `input` elements in your form have a `name` attribute to save the data entered in that field.
> ### 2. Configure your form actions
> By default, form submissions are automatically saved for you. You can configure several other actions to run when a form is submitted, like sending an email notification or subscribing to Mailchimp.
> ### 3. Show the form somewhere on your site
> Show your form by using the `[hf_form]` shortcode in your WordPress posts, pages or widget areas.

## HTML Forms features

- Full control over the HTML for the form fields. If you want, we'll help you in generating the field HTML though.
- Each form submission is automatically saved in your database and can be viewed in a simple table format.
- Configure an unlimited amount of actions to run when a form is successfully submitted. For example, sending out email notifications.
- Access form field values by referencing the field name, eg `[NAME]` or `[EMAIL]`.
- Hide form or redirect to URL after a successful submission.
- Configurable & translatable form messages.
- Field validation.
- Developer friendly. HTML Forms comes with a myriad of [JavaScript events](https://kb.htmlforms.io/javascript-events/) and WordPress hooks that allow you to modify or extend the plugin's default behavior.

## Who is this for?

HTML Forms is for everyone that wants a flexible & high performing form solution.

- Users. Managing your own site? With HTML Forms, you don't need any technical knowledge to setup a contact form.
- Developers. Building a site for your client? You supply the form HTML, HTML Forms takes care of validating and processing the form.
- Theme developers. Shipping a theme? HTML Forms allows for complete blend-in with your theme, and you don't have to write yet another contact form plugin.

With HTML Forms you can create any type of form. Contact forms, registration forms, price quote forms, you name it. It's somewhat similar to Contact Form 7, but without yet another template language for you to learn.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Where can I find help?
Start by going through the [HTML Forms knowledge base](https://kb.htmlforms.io/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=html-forms&utm_campaign=plugin-faq) where we cover a wide range of frequently asked questions.

#### How to display a form in posts or pages?
Use the `[hf_form]` shortcode.

#### How to display a form in widget areas like the sidebar or footer?
Go to **Appearance > Widgets**, add the "Text Widget" to any of your widget areas and use the `[hf_form]` shortcode.

#### How do I show a form in a pop-up?

We recommend the [Boxzilla pop-up plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/boxzilla/) for this. You can use the `[hf_form]` shortcode in your pop-up box to render any of your forms.

#### Can I send an email when the form is submitted?

Yes! You can configure this by opening up the "Actions" tab when editing your form and clicking the "Email" button under "Available actions".

### Does the plugin include anti-spam measures?

The plugin comes with built-in spam protection that should stop all automated attacks. When the built-in protection doesn't cut it, [WPBruiser](https://wordpress.org/plugins/goodbye-captcha/) surely will.
